  Total Open Station
 ====================
 .
 Total Open Station (TOPS for friends) is a free software program for
 downloading and processing data from total station devices, written in
 the Python programming language.
 .
 This is a task which is usually done by proprietary, dedicated and
 Windowsâ„¢-only software, but TOPS is different by nature, because:
 .
 - it is *free/libre open source software*;
 - it works on *any* operating system where Python is available;
 - it is designed to support as many devices and formats as possible, all
   within the same program, opposed to having one program per device.
 .
 Every model has its own quirks, but TOPS uses a modular structure and
 keeps the downloading of data logically separated from its processing,
 thus enabling exporting data to a variety of output formats, even at a
 later moment. Archiving of raw data is made easy by using plain text
